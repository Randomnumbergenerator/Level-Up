<h3>A fun to-do list</h3>

<h4> About this app </h4>

The team set out on a journey to apply our skills in a totally baller project.

This convenient single page application is a to-do list generator. 
A user can log in and add a new to-do list. The list populates their screen and they can abruptly start to add tasks to the created list. We have given the user the option of selecting how many “points” to assign each task depending on the tasks importance or difficulty.  Once the task is complete the user can check it off and it will be completed. At anytime a user can delete a list or a task with ease.


The points. Points are arbitrary; they have no value and mean nothing. We refused to tell the user what the points are for and instead gave the user the freedom to invent suitable rewards for whatever they want their points to mean for them. 


Future goals

Future installments of this revolutionary application will focus on the gaming community. We would like to have premade to-do lists for every type of gaming genre. (Table top, card game, video game, board game). A user could preselect a to-do list to help them get their next gaming event under way. 

We would like to install the ability to share to-do lists with multiply users. Ideally one user could create a list and share it with other users to create a community of productivity.  Anyone could update the list and it would reflect on all other shared lists. 

With the ability to share lists while focusing on the gaming community the points then could translate to rewards for in game characters for what the person accomplished within their community to-do list. Again we would never tell people what to use the points for but one example might be a Dungeon Master giving Hero Points to a player that brought the pizza to the adventure.
